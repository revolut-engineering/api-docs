        This endpoint retrieves the recent transactions for an account.

        >In order to ensure compliance with PSD2 SCA regulations, we only allow access to the last 90 days’ transaction history. However, you will be able to access older transactions within the first 5 minutes of an account access token being authorised. This means that within the first 5 minutes of acquiring the access token, you will be able to request data older than 90 days. After the 5 minute mark, access will be automatically restricted to the last 90 days worth of data.

        This endpoint is for creating payment consent as described in Open Banking API documentation. Domestic payments are used for local payments in the local currency of the user. Revolut supports only GBP as local in the UK and EUR in Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) countries.

        Since Revolut Business users can have multiple accounts in the same currency, we allow them to choose which account they want to be charged in the consent authorization UI.

        As part of the API requirement you must pass `x-jws-signature` header in your request. The signature must be generated from the request body with the TPP signing key that is specified in the JWS header. As specified in the documentation, you must only pass `head` and `signature` in `<jws_head>..<jws_signature>` format.

        >Unfortunately, we cannot support the EndToEndIdentification field as it is described in the documentation. We will update the [documentation](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/1000702294/Read+Write+Data+API+Specification+-+v3.1.1) once we get support for it.

        This endpoint is for creating payment consent as described in Open Banking API documentation. International Payments are used for international SWIFT payments in all currencies supported by Revolut.

        Only payments with `InstructedAmount` in the same currency as `CurrencyOfTransfer` are supported. However, we allow users to change which account they want to be charged in consent authorization UI. Even if it is in a different currency. In such a case, the response field ExchangeRateInformation will contain information about the fx rate between source account currency and CurrencyOfTransfer. In case the user doesn't have enough funds on the selected account, the consent authorisation will be rejected.

        As part of the API requirement, you must pass the `x-jws-signature` header in your request. The signature must be generated from a request body with the TPP signing key that is specified in the JWS header. As specified in the documentation, you must only pass `head` and `signature` in `<jws_head>..<jws_signature>` format.

        >Unfortunately, we cannot support the **EndToEndIdentification** field as it is described in the [documentation](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/1000702294/Read+Write+Data+API+Specification+-+v3.1.1). We will update the documentation once we get support for it.
        International payments API is currently in Beta stage - some elements of the UI might not fully visualise the consent data.

        This endpoint is for creating scheduled payment consent as described in Open Banking API documentation. International Scheduled Payments are used for international SWIFT payments in all currencies supported by Revolut.

        Only payments with `InstructedAmount` in the same currency as `CurrencyOfTransfer` are supported. However, we allow users to change which account they want to be charged in consent authorization UI. Even if it is in a different currency. In case the user doesn't have enough funds on the selected account, the consent authorisation will be rejected.

        As part of the API requirement, you must pass the `x-jws-signature` header in your request. The signature must be generated from a request body with the TPP signing key that is specified in the JWS header. As specified in the documentation, you must only pass `head` and `signature` in `<jws_head>..<jws_signature>` format.

        `Scheduled payments API is currently in Beta stage - some elements of the UI might not fully visualise the consent data.`

      description: |
        Once you have gained an access token using our [draft payments authorisation guide](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking-api/#api-references-draft-payments), you can use the `/draft_payments` endpoint to create a draft payment on behalf of the customer. A draft payment will appear on their account, where they can approve or reject the draft payment.

        You can use the same `/draft_payments` endpoint to make multiple draft payments by using new rows for new draft payments. For every draft payment request you make, you will have to make sure that they are using the same currency. On a successful request with multiple draft payments, you will recieve one `DraftPaymentID` that will represent all the draft payments associated with your request.
